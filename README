# circle-eater

This project is meant only to explore using compojure, clj-http and cheshire together with amon-log to record data.

Circle eater searches for data it generates and passes it to amon.There is a timer cycling every n seconds which makes clj-http requests at a randomized endpoint on its own host, which it catches in turn and returns randomly generated json data as a response. It then logs that data to a local amon instance.
